###ALGhaith
####September 2012 to July 2013
####Members:Mahmoud Fayyaz, Rabya Nasr, Mohamed Wahba, Ahmed Jamal
Designing a search engine is one of the oldest Computer Science problems and still poses a number of challenges. Having ultra-huge companies which are taking over the control with money and power, the most important thing is satisfying users’ demands.

Due to the lack of Arabic information on the web, users are sometimes not satisfied with the results obtained from the common search engines. These demands the presence of intelligent search engines that understand the data given in hand and understand the user request to for a better service to the user.

We have designed Al-Ghaith to work specifically on Arabic language. That because Arabic language is integral to majority of the population of the Middle-East. The language distinct them from countries in other regions and it is also a language manifest in their faith. Arabic is the official lan- guage of hundreds of millions of people in twenty Middle East and northern African countries, and is the religious language of all Muslims of various eth- nicities around the world. It is a Semitic language with 28 alphabet letters.

We have faced some challenges such as inherent properties of the Arabic lan- guage, the Arabic script (no short vowels and no capitalization), explosion of ambiguity (average 2.3 per word in other languages to 19.2 in Arabic), com- plex word structure and the problem of Normalization and losing distinction.

Al-Ghaith is working semantically not lexically and that makes it under- standing the metadata and queries too. Building a search engine to work semantically will lead to a lot of challenges such as handling morphological variations, handling concept matching, handling knowledge matching, the ability to enter queries freely, no special formats like quotes, or Boolean op- erators and the ability to operate without relying on statistics, user behavior, and other artificial means.
